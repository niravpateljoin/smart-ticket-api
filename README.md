You will see output like:
```
Dispatched classify job for X tickets.
```

Make sure your queue worker is running:
```bash
php artisan queue:work
```

## ‚è∞ 9. Schedule with Cron

To run the bulk classification periodically, add the following to your crontab:

```bash
* * * * * cd /path-to-your-project && php artisan schedule:run >> /dev/null 2>&1
```

This ensures that every 5 minutes, the bulk classification will be checked and dispatched if needed.
